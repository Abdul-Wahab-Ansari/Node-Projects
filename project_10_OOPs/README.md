# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Project with TypeScript
This project is designed to enhance understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using TypeScript. It involves the implementation of classes, inheritance, and other OOP principles to create a simple application.

## Project Overview
The project consists of the following files:

 - `main.ts:` This is the main TypeScript file where the program execution begins. It includes the logic to interact with the user and instantiate objects of the Person and Student classes.

 - `PersonClass:` This file defines the Person class, which represents a generic person. It includes methods for asking questions to determine the person's personality and accessing the personality value.

 - `StudentClass:` This file extends the Person class to create the Student class. It introduces additional properties and methods specific to a student, such as the student's name.


### How Run the Program

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. 
2. **Clone Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
3. **Install Dependencies:** Use `npm install or npm i` to install dependencies.
4. **Run the Program:** Start the application by running following commands:

```
tsc
then node main.js on command line
```

5. Follow the prompts to interact with the program and observe the OOP concepts in action.

## Technologies Used:
 - `TypeScript:` A superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language.
 - `Node.js:` A JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server-side.
 - `Inquirer:` A command-line interface for Node.js that facilitates user input.\

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to reinforce understanding of OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism using TypeScript. By implementing classes and objects in a real-world scenario, learners can gain practical experience and solidify their knowledge of OOP concepts.
